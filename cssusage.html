<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. 
    The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', 
    making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and 
    web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. 
    Various versions have evolved over the years, 
    sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
<p id="shibu"> Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. 
    Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, 
    and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, 
    discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections</p>

    Crafting the perfect love message and expressing how much you care about someone may be difficult, but it can also be incredibly rewarding. 
    Making your love known to that special someone is one of those little things that not just keep relationships alive, but also helps them flourish.

    But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system,
     and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,
      because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who
       loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.
        To take a trivial example, 
       which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to 
       find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, 
       or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"

Section 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", written by Cicero in 45 BC
"At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium 
voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, 
similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga. 
Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio 
cumque nihil impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda est, omnis dolor repellendus. 
Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis aut rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae sint et 
molestiae non recusandae. Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus, ut aut reiciendis voluptatibus maiores alias consequatur 
aut perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat."
matters to this principle of selection: he rejects 
pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
